farmer-to-farmer
================

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Farmer John' with 'John Peters, you know, the farmer'. Too many programming challanges use the generic Farmer John, and I think that John Peters, you know, the farmer, deserves a little more recognition. Not that his invisible corn isn't recognition enough.

Fork of the cloud-to-butt repo (which is amazing).

Installation
